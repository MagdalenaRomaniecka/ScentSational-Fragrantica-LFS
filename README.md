## 💎 Project Overview

**ScentSational AI Core** is the backend intelligence engine designed to revolutionize fragrance discovery. Unlike traditional filters that rely solely on checkboxes, this engine uses **Semantic Search** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to understand the *vibe* of a scent (e.g., *"dark, woody notes with a luxury feel"*).

This repository serves as the computational brain, separating heavy logic from the visual presentation layer.

## 📐 Architecture & Ecosystem

This project is part of a dual-repository architecture designed for scalability and clean code separation.

## ⚙️ Key Features & Tech Stack

This engine translates abstract concepts into mathematical vectors using state-of-the-art ML libraries.

* **Sentence-Transformers (SBERT)**: Generates dense vector representations (embeddings) of perfume notes.
* **Cosine Similarity**: Calculates the mathematical distance between scent profiles to find the nearest neighbors.
* **Git LFS (Large File Storage)**: Used to host heavy model artifacts required for inference.
* **Stack**: Python 3.9+, Streamlit, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn.

## 💻 Installation & Usage

To run this backend engine locally:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository (ensure Git LFS is installed)
git clone [https://github.com/MagdalenaRomaniecka/ScentSational-Fragrantica-LFS.git](https://github.com/MagdalenaRomaniecka/ScentSational-Fragrantica-LFS.git)

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Run the application
streamlit run app.py

```
## 📂 Data Source & LFS Structure

Due to GitHub's file size limits, this repository uses **Git LFS** to host artifacts.

| File Name | Description | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `scent_embeddings.pkl` | Vectorized representation of 40k+ perfumes | **Semantic Database** |
| `scentsational_data.csv` | Raw metadata (Brand, Notes, Ratings) | **Source Data** |

> **Data Source:** This project utilizes the [Fragrantica Perfumes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olgagmiufana1/fragrantica-com-fragrance-dataset) sourced from Kaggle.
